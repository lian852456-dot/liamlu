# North12B v4 artifact entry

`run_report.py` builds a source-driven private daily workbook, closure workbook and PNGs. It does not publish website data or send mail. Existing source identity, roster, reconciliation, website, duplicate-mail and post-send gates still apply.

```sh
python scripts/north12b/run_report.py \
  --source /private/current/MMDD.xlsx \
  --previous-source /private/previous/MMDD.xlsx \
  --previous-kpi /private/previous/verified-kpicalc.json \
  --template /private/template-v4.xlsx \
  --run-dir /private/current-run \
  --report-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --font-dir /private/verified-font-assets
```

The current source and template are required. Previous source/KPI arguments are optional. Omit missing inputs; do not manufacture prior records. The personal detailed roster in today's source is authoritative. A store-section export requires a verified roster for role and identity resolution.

Missing prior values never block current-day artifacts. DOD is `暫不比較` when the baseline is absent, untrusted or from another month. Explicit zero with an independently valid baseline remains comparable. A month-start export with no valid KPI targets cannot supply an achievement baseline. Source read failures and malformed files remain errors, distinct from missing data.

Insurance uses the core source's canonical nine-store order. Missing stores retain `尚未有資料`; other stores retain source numbers, including zero. Insurance cutoff comes from the personal insurance sheet's actual period. Unknown cutoffs remain pending and cannot support DOD. QIS values are retained even if only the full-month reporting interval is supplied; the actual cutoff remains pending.

Final PNGs are rendered once after v4 layout. Goodspeed uses `../render_goodspeed_detail.py`, including its private receipt, verification and dynamic pages. Manifest rows follow the generated worksheets and receipt files. `PENDING_VISUAL_REVIEW` must be replaced only after actual visual review. No publisher may treat workbook creation or an unreviewed manifest as permission to publish.

Outputs and processing records belong in the private run directory. Never commit private source, roster, report, template, receipt or snapshot files to this repository.

Regression: `node --test tests/north12b-dod.test.mjs`. The source-to-artifact run must also be verified against the actual daily source, including a missing-prior case, zero values, missing store rows, closure reconciliation and CJK visuals.
